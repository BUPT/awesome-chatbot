## Code of Conduct

### 1. Problem-driven

> _"When you are being problem-driven, you approach product development and design not just based on specific features being requested of you, but by determining the underlying problems that your product is supposed to solve."_  
> -- Leonid Batkhan, [Purpose-driven vs problem-driven vs solution-driven](http://www.lenetek.com/blog/purpose-driven-problem-driven-solution-driven/)

### 2. Code first, paper second

> _"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."_  
> -- Torvalds, Linus (2000-08-25). [Message to linux-kernel mailing list.](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132)

### 3. Always ask questions

> ✔ _He who asks a question remains a fool for five minutes;_  
> ✕ _He who does not ask remains a fool forever._

### 4. Always follow the **two-pizza rule**

> _"Never have a meeting where two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group."_  
> -- Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO
